# Self Hosting Media Group

We're a group that develop tools to make self-hosting media easier! We mainly focus on streamlining the process of downloading, encoding, and organizing the medias. So making your own media library is easier than ever!

> Support the original whenever possible. You may not be able to own every piece of media you love, but please, support the original if you can.
