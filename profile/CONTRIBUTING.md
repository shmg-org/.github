# Contributing

Please follow this guideline when contributing!

- [Commit Message](#commit-message)
- [Pull Request Message](#pull-request-message)

## Commit Message

Use the following format when writing a commit message:

```
<type>(<scope?>): <message>`
```

> [!NOTE]
> The scope is optional, in most cases you wouldn't need this.

Use the following rules to determine the type of your commit:

- **feat**: When a feature is added.
- **update**: When something is updated.
- **fix**: When something is fixed.
- **style**: When the style of the code is changed.
- **refactor**: When the code is refactored.

## Pull Request Message

The same as [Commit Message](#commit-message).
